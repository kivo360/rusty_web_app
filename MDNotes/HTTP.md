# Rust and HTTP Services

For this HTTP app we need to be able to handle the following parts:

1. The http calls from the user to set and get relevant information.
    1. Register User Upon Sign-up.
    1. Set/get their favorite streamer.
    1. Get information about the streamer they're watching (the latest 10 items).
1. Connecting to the websocket to receive even information dynamically.
